# Matan Retzer GenAI Solutions

Professional GenAI consulting and training website for Matan Retzer (M.Sc.)

This project is a modern, responsive landing page for GenAI consulting and training, built for Matan Retzer (M.Sc.), featuring bilingual support (Hebrew/English), a contemporary design, and all essential consulting site features.

## Features

- **Bilingual Interface**: Instantly switch between Hebrew and English using a flag button.
- **Modern Design**: Clean, Apple-inspired layout with smooth flow and subtle animations.
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Sections Included**:
  - Hero section with professional information and social links
  - About section
  - Services section (including GenAI solution development, consulting, and training)
  - Contact form (integrated with Formspree for easy email delivery)
  - Contact details and social icons
- **Easy Deployment**: All files are static (HTML, CSS, JS, SVG), making it ideal for GitHub Pages deployment.
- **SEO-Optimized**: Semantic HTML and best practices for discoverability.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Add your profile image as `profile.jpg` in the root directory.**
3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Place all provided files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `lang.js`, SVG icons, and `profile.jpg`) in the root of your repository (or the `docs/` folder if configured).
   - Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.

4. **Contact Form**:
   - The form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for email delivery. You can update the form's `action` attribute in `index.html` with your own Formspree endpoint or any backend of your choice.
